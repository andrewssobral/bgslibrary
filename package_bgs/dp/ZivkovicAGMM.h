/****************************************************************************
*
* ZivkovicAGMM.hpp
*
* Purpose: Implementation of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) background 
*		  		 subtraction algorithm developed by Z. Zivkovic.
*
* Author: Donovan Parks, September 2007
*
* This code is based on code by Z. Zivkovic's. I have changed it from a pure
* C implementation to a cleaner (IMHO) C++ implementation. It is based on the
* following papers:
*
*	"Improved adaptive Gausian mixture model for background subtraction"
*		Z.Zivkovic 
*		International Conference Pattern Recognition, UK, August, 2004
*
*
* "Efficient Adaptive Density Estimapion per Image Pixel for the 
*			Task of Background Subtraction"
*		Z.Zivkovic, F. van der Heijden 
*		Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 27, no. 7, pages 773-780, 2006.
*
* Zivkovic's code can be obtained at: www.zoranz.net

Example:
Algorithms::BackgroundSubtraction::ZivkovicParams params;
params.SetFrameSize(width, height);
params.LowThreshold() = 5.0f*5.0f;
params.HighThreshold() = 2*params.LowThreshold();	// Note: high threshold is used by post-processing 
params.Alpha() = 0.001f;
params.MaxModes() = 3;

Algorithms::BackgroundSubtraction::ZivkovicAGMM bgs;
bgs.Initalize(params);
