*
* GrimsonGMM.cpp
*
* Purpose: Implementation of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) background 
*		  		 subtraction described in:
*	  			 "Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking"
* 						by Chris Stauffer and W.E.L Grimson
*
* Author: Donovan Parks, September 2007
*
* This code is based on code by Z. Zivkovic's written for his enhanced GMM
* background subtraction algorithm: 
*
*	"Improved adaptive Gausian mixture model for background subtraction"
*		Z.Zivkovic 
*		International Conference Pattern Recognition, UK, August, 2004
*
*
* "Efficient Adaptive Density Estimapion per Image Pixel for the 
*			Task of Background Subtraction"
*		Z.Zivkovic, F. van der Heijden 
*		Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 27, no. 7, pages 773-780, 2006.
*
* Zivkovic's code can be obtained at: www.zoranz.net

Example:
		Algorithms::BackgroundSubtraction::GrimsonParams params;
		params.SetFrameSize(width, height);
		params.LowThreshold() = 3.0f*3.0f;
		params.HighThreshold() = 2*params.LowThreshold();	// Note: high threshold is used by post-processing 
		params.Alpha() = 0.001f;
		params.MaxModes() = 3;

		Algorithms::BackgroundSubtraction::GrimsonGMM bgs;
		bgs.Initalize(params);
